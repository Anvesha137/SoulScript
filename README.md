## Inspiration
Let's be honest - I didn't set out to build some profound spiritual tool. I was just another burnt-out human drowning in to-do lists, drinking cold coffee at 3 PM while my phone buzzed with notifications. The "aha" moment came when I caught myself Googling "why does everything feel meaningless" for the third time that week. All those productivity apps kept telling me to do more, but what I needed was something to help me be more. So I built SoulScript - not because I had some grand vision, but because I needed a place where my existential dread could meet something wiser than my Twitter feed.

## What it does
SoulScript is like that one friend who actually listens instead of just waiting for their turn to talk. You dump your messy thoughts ("Why am I like this?" counts as a valid entry), and it:
1. Actually understands when you're venting vs. actually asking for advice
2. Pulls from ancient texts (Bhagavad Gita, Bible, etc.) but explains them like a human ("Krishna isn't saying quit your job - he's saying chill about outcomes")
3. Remembers your patterns (turns out I write "I'm so tired" every Monday at 2:37 PM)
4. Doesn't preach - no "just meditate!" nonsense when you're mid-meltdown

## What's next for SoulScript: AI Life Companion
1. Voice journaling, because sometimes you need to process life while ugly-crying in your car.
2. "Oh, THIS is your pattern" alerts. Like: "You journal about loneliness every full moon. Maybe call a friend tonight?"
3. Community wisdom that is letting users anonymously share what helped them
4. Anti-productivity mode. Like a button that says: "No, you don't need to optimize your life today. Here's a poem instead."
